# PaySage Wallet Mobile App Mockups

This directory contains descriptions of how the PaySage Wallet mobile app would appear on iOS and Android devices. Below are detailed visualization descriptions for each screen.

## Login Screen
The login screen features a clean white background with the PaySage logo centered at the top. Below are input fields for username and password with a subtle border. The "Sign In" button is prominent in the brand's primary purple color (#4f46e5). At the bottom, there's a "Don't have an account? Sign up" option for new users.

## Dashboard
The dashboard has a gradient header in the brand's primary purple color displaying the current balance prominently in white text. Below is a quick-access row of circular action buttons for Add Money, Send Money, Cards, and Carbon Impact, each with a distinctive icon. The recent transactions section shows card-style entries with transaction details including amount, recipient/sender, and date, all in a clean list format with subtle separation lines.

## Wallet Screen
The wallet screen showcases virtual card representations of the user's accounts. Each card is displayed in a 3D perspective with the account type, balance, and last 4 digits of the account number. Below the cards is an accounts section showing detailed balances in different currencies, and a transaction history section. The screen uses the brand's color palette with cards in purple, green, and blue gradients.

## Send Money
The send money screen has a clean form-based layout with recipient selection at the top (including recent contacts), followed by amount entry with a large number pad. The currency selector allows switching between available currencies. The note field lets users add transaction descriptions. At the bottom is a prominent "Send Money" button in the brand's primary purple, and a transaction fee breakdown.

## Transactions
The transactions screen features a filterable list with tabs for All, Received, Sent, and Deposits transactions. Each transaction is displayed in a card format with an icon indicating the transaction type (arrows for sends/receives, plus sign for deposits), the transaction amount in green or red based on type, the recipient/sender name, and timestamp. A search bar at the top allows filtering by keywords.

## Cards Management
The cards screen displays virtual replicas of physical cards with realistic detailing including card number (partially masked), expiry date, cardholder name, and card network logo. Cards can be flipped to reveal additional details. Below each card are quick action buttons for freezing/unfreezing, viewing details, and setting limits. A prominent "Add New Card" button appears at the bottom.

## Profile
The profile screen begins with the user's avatar (or initials in a colored circle), name, and email. Below are sections for personal information, security settings (with toggles for biometric authentication, notifications, and dark mode), and account preferences. At the bottom is a red "Logout" button. The interface uses clear section dividers and icons for each setting.

## Carbon Impact
The carbon impact screen features a visual graph of the user's carbon footprint over time, with green and red areas indicating offsets and impacts. Below is a breakdown of impact by category (transportation, utilities, shopping) with progress bars in varying colors. The screen includes an "Offset Your Impact" button that leads to carbon offset purchase options, and a tips section for reducing environmental impact.

These detailed descriptions represent how the PaySage Wallet mobile app would appear on iOS and Android platforms, maintaining consistency with the web application while optimizing for mobile interaction patterns.
